Project Name
==============

At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.). To ensure that the project properly displays on
the [open source project listing](http://atlassian.bitbucket.org/), you should also do the following:

1. the project description that is displayed is pulled from the *Repository details: Description* within the repo *Settings*
2. the *Repository details: Language* should be specified within the repo *Settings*

Optionally, include a short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.

Usage
======

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.


Installation
============

Provide instructions on how to install and configure the project.

Documentation
=============

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the docs or API reference live.

Tests
=====

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
